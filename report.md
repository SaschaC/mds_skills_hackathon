# Week 1

TODO:
 - My skill will comprise 3 parts: random fact generation for the 8 planets in our solar system based on scraped web data, Mars weather information based on NASA API, exoplanet search based on NASA API and others.  
   - Step 1: data gathering, API search, conceptualization of the skills.
   - Step 2: developping dialogue flow for natural language queries in exoplanet search and Mars weather information.
   - Step 3:  Implement search execution based natural language queries provided by user. 
   - Step 4: Expand dialogue flow to customize presentation of serach results.
   - Step 5: Implement different scenarios of search result presentation.
   - Step 6 (optional): Research methods for Natural language to database query conversion and implment one method.  
 
WIP:
 - I am gathering different data sources to use for the exoplanet search. Sources I will use are:
   - [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS)
   - [Exoplanet Open Catalogue](http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/planet/11%20Com%20b/)
   - [Mars Weather API](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/)
 - I am working on the dialogue flow to provide search parameters by the user for exoplanet search.  

Done:
 - I implemented a basic dialogue flow.
 - I scraped data from Wikipedia.
 - The assistant generates random facts for any of the 8 planets in our solar system based on the scraped Wikipedia data.
